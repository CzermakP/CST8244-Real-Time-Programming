# Title: Lab3 signals and handlers PART A 

## Status: 
	My lab meets the requirements of this lab.
	Does not terminate unexpectedly.
	When i tried to KILL the the process with SIGUSR2 instead of SIGUSR1 with the proper <PID> , it still killed the process but didn't show anthing in the Momentics console
	and in the QNX console it showed 'no such process' but then when i executed 'pidin | grep partA' there was nothing there, so it did in fact kill the process. (NOT SURE
	IF THIS IS EXPECTED OR NOT)  
	NOTE: had to re-create project in C++, as in C it created errors on the usr1Happened variable declaration
	
## Known Issues:
	none that aware of 
	
## Expected Grade:
	A
