Collaborated on:
transition table
des.h
des_inputs.cpp

Josef's Part:

des_display.cpp

Patrick's Part:
Diagrams
inputs
outputs
states

Status:
All requirements are meet with the exception of using function pointers. 
The program functions as expected and there are no run-time errors.
if the user enters an input that is not part of the input list it is invalid,
and if the user enters a non-integer for the ID or the weight it is invalid

Known Issues:
Function pointers are not used, but the functions work as expected.
Function pointers did not seem neccessary since we used a transition table.

Expected Grade:
A
